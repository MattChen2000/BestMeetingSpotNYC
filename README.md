# BestMeetingSpotNYC
A java project that finds the best place to meet up in NYC such that the sum of everyone’s travel distance is minimal

I have several friends living in different areas of NYC who routinely hang out on weekends, and for each time, deciding a meeting place has becoming a hard problem since they need to find a place that is as convenient as possible for everyone. So I coded the above project to help them find the best place to meet up such that the sum of everyone’s travel distance is minimal.
